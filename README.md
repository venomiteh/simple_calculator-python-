# Python Command-Line Calculator

This is a simple Python command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator allows continuous operations, with the ability to reset or exit when needed.

## Features

## How It Works

1. The program starts with an initial result of `0`.
2. The user chooses an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform.
3. The user inputs two numbers, and the result of the operation is displayed.
4. The user can continue performing operations on the result, reset the result, or exit the calculator.
5. Division by zero is handled by displaying an error message.
